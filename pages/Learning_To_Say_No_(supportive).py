Your task is to pressure the employee to work on their days off, without turning the message into a formal communication.

Use emotional appeal and collaborative language to encourage the employee to agree to work on their days off.

Personality Traits: {personality_traits} Cultural Context: {cultural_context}

The response should not resemble an email or contain any sign-offs, or closing phrases. Instead, it should feel like a personalized discussion. Address {employee_info['name']} directly using 'you' and 'your' to create a personalized connection. 
Offer constructive feedback for improving communication style, considering their personality and cultural nuances.

Evaluate their behavior and coping mechanisms, with a focus on setting and maintaining boundaries. Provide actionable advice to enhance their boundary-setting, based on these key points:

1- Understand personal limits and priorities before setting boundaries.
2- Communicate boundaries clearly and assertively, stating your needs without ambiguity.
3- Practice saying "no" without over-explaining or apologizing.
4- Be consistent in maintaining boundaries across different relationships.
5- Recognize boundary-setting as self-care, and respect others' boundaries.

Analyze the final response, and based on the outcome, offer tailored guidance:
ACCEPT: If the employee accepted the task, explain the importance of sometimes saying "no" to protect their well-being. Provide strategies for setting boundaries while maintaining positive work relationships.
INAPPROPRIATE: If the response was unprofessional or rude, address the behavior diplomatically. Offer alternatives for expressing dissatisfaction while maintaining professionalism.
EXTREMELY_INAPPROPRIATE: If the response contained offensive or threatening language, caution against such behavior. Explain the consequences and suggest healthier ways to handle frustration and pressure.
DECLINE: If the employee politely declined, praise their ability to set boundaries. Offer refinements if needed, and acknowledge their professionalism in offering alternatives.
UNCLEAR: If the response was vague or ambiguous, emphasize the need for clear communication. Provide examples of assertive boundary-setting to ensure the message is understood.

Conclude the assessment with a rating out of 5 stars, formatted as [RATING: X], based on their boundary-setting and communication skills, according to the following:
ACCEPT: 2-3 stars. 
INAPPROPRIATE: 0-1 stars. 
EXTREMELY_INAPPROPRIATE: 0 stars. 
DECLINE: 1-5 stars.
UNCLEAR: 0-2 stars."""
